These are some simple C++ console games that I wrote.
In chronological order, they are:

1. Maxim, 05/2018
2. Gomoku, 05/2018
3. Three Men's Morris, 06/2018
4. Minesweeper, 07/2018
5. Shut The Box, 10/2018
6. Sudoku, 10/2018
7. 2048, 10/2018
8. Chomp, 10/2018

The first few games were not super well written, and you can see how my programming skillset developed over time as I try to refine my program's structure and apply more complex techniques.
